MIDI player example
===================

This example is a proof-of-concept for a MIDI player widget that might later be implemented as a Pux module.

Building
--------

From the current directory

    $ bower install
    $ ./build.sh

The code is built as example.js in the player/dist directory. This is runnable if you open the corresponding index.html.
